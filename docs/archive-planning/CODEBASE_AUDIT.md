# Codebase Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit examines the YC Cofounder Matching Bot codebase to identify critical misalignments between the documented vision and current implementation. The codebase follows clean Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with a ports-and-adapters architecture but implements the **opposite workflow** from what's documented. The current implementation expects manual profile pasting, while the documented vision requires autonomous browser operation with OpenAI CUA.

## Current State Analysis

### Architecture Overview

```
src/yc_matcher/
├── domain/           # Business logic (entities, services)
├── application/      # Use cases and ports
├── infrastructure/   # Adapters (browser, AI, storage)
└── interface/       # UI (Streamlit, CLI)
```

**Good:** Clean separation of concerns, testable architecture, proper abstraction layers.

**Problem:** Implementation is backwards from documented requirements.

### Critical Misalignments

#### 1. Browser Automation Direction
- **Current:** PlaywrightBrowser implements manual navigation after paste
- **Required:** OpenAI CUA autonomous browsing from 3 inputs
- **Gap:** No CUA adapter exists, Playwright used for wrong purpose

#### 2. User Interface Flow
- **Current:** ui_streamlit.py shows "Paste & Evaluate" workflow
- **Required:** 3-input control panel (URL, criteria, limits)
- **Gap:** Complete UI rewrite needed

#### 3. Decision System
- **Current:** OpenAIDecisionAdapter uses `responses.create()` for evaluation
- **Required:** CUA for browsing, then decision modes (Advisor/Rubric/Hybrid)
- **Gap:** Conflates browsing with evaluation

#### 4. Process Flow
```
Current Flow (WRONG):
User → Paste Profile → Evaluate → Maybe Send

Required Flow (RIGHT):
User → 3 Inputs → CUA Browse → Extract → Decide → Auto-Send
```

### Code Quality Assessment

#### Strengths
1. **Clean Architecture:** Proper DDD with ports/adapters
2. **Test Coverage:** 18 test files, unit/integration split
3. **Type Safety:** Full mypy typing throughout
4. **Dependency Injection:** Clean DI in interface/di.py
5. **Safety Controls:** STOP flag, quotas, seen tracking

#### Weaknesses
1. **Wrong Core Flow:** Manual paste instead of autonomous
2. **Missing CUA Integration:** No OpenAI CUA browser adapter
3. **UI Misalignment:** Streamlit shows wrong workflow
4. **Test Gaps:** No tests for CUA integration
5. **Decision Modes:** Missing Advisor/Rubric/Hybrid modes

### Technical Debt

1. **Playwright Misuse:** Currently used for send operations, should be replaced by CUA
2. **OpenAI Adapter Confusion:** `openai_decision.py` should be evaluation-only
3. **Hardcoded Workflow:** ProcessCandidate assumes manual flow
4. **Missing Abstractions:** No CUA port definition
5. **Template System:** Assumes manual context, needs autonomous rewrite

### Security & Safety

**Good Practices:**
- File-based STOP flag for emergency abort
- Quota management (daily/weekly caps)
- Seen tracking to prevent duplicates
- JSONL event logging for audit trail

**Needs Improvement:**
- CUA screenshot privacy controls
- Rate limiting for CUA API calls
- Sandboxing for autonomous operations

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Complete workflow reversal needed** - Core logic must flip
2. **No CUA implementation** - Critical missing component
3. **UI total rewrite** - Current UI unusable for intended flow

### Medium Risk
1. **Test suite invalidation** - Most tests assume wrong flow
2. **Breaking API changes** - Ports need redesign
3. **Data migration** - Logs/tracking need schema updates

### Low Risk
1. **Infrastructure adapters** - Can mostly be reused
2. **Safety controls** - Already well-implemented
3. **Domain entities** - Core models remain valid

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Stop all feature work on current flow
2. Create CUA browser adapter prototype
3. Design new 3-input UI mockup
4. Define decision mode interfaces

### Short-term (Sprint 1)
1. Implement OpenAICUABrowser adapter
2. Create new ports for CUA operations
3. Rewrite ProcessCandidate for autonomous flow
4. Build decision mode system

### Medium-term (Sprint 2-3)
1. Replace Streamlit UI with 3-input panel
2. Implement all decision modes
3. Create CUA-specific test suite
4. Add monitoring for autonomous operations

## Conclusion

The codebase is well-structured but implements the wrong product. The architecture supports the needed changes, but requires fundamental workflow reversal. The good news: clean architecture makes this refactoring feasible. The bad news: almost all application and interface code needs rewriting.

**Verdict:** Complete refactoring required, but foundation is solid.
