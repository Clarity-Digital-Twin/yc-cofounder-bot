Roadmap (Post‑MVP)

Near‑Term
- Streamlit UI with live screenshot feed and action log.
- Per‑run history and cross‑run dedupe (SQLite).
- Tunable message templates with A/B variants.

Mid‑Term
- Scheduling small batches; pacing controls.
- Export summaries to CSV/Sheets; contact enrichment hooks.
- Better scoring (vector keywords, small rules engine).

Longer‑Term (Evaluate)
- Multi‑site adapters (only if ToS allows and truly needed).
- Prompt/policy management UI for safe collaboration.
- Advanced observability (sessions viewer, cost dashboard).
