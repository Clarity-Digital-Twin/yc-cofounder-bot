# CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS - WHERE WE ACTUALLY STAND

## 1. WHAT'S IMPLEMENTED

### âœ… OpenAI CUA (Computer Use API) - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **File**: `src/yc_matcher/infrastructure/openai_cua_browser.py`
- **Status**: Complete Responses API loop with `computer_use_preview`
- Uses `responses.create()` with proper parameters
- Chains with `previous_response_id`
- Sends screenshots via `computer_call_output`
- Has safety check handling
- Turn cap implemented (`CUA_MAX_TURNS`)

### âœ… Playwright Executor - WORKING
- **File**: `src/yc_matcher/infrastructure/browser_playwright_async.py`
- Browser singleton pattern (shared AsyncLoopRunner)
- Auto-login implemented and working
- Profile navigation works

### âœ… Decision Modes - ALL THREE IMPLEMENTED
- **Advisor**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 for decisions (via Responses API)
- **Rubric**: Deterministic scoring based on keywords
- **Hybrid**: Rubric gate first, then Advisor for confirmation

## 2. CURRENT PROBLEMS

### ðŸ”´ CUA is DISABLED
```env
ENABLE_CUA=0  # Currently OFF
ENABLE_PLAYWRIGHT=1  # Using Playwright-only mode
```

### ðŸ”´ When clicking "Start Autonomous Browsing" - gets 0 profiles
**Root cause**: After auto-login, YC redirects to `/candidate/[ID]` (already on a profile page), but our code looks for "View Profile" button which doesn't exist there.

### ðŸ”´ CUA Model Name Wrong
```env
CUA_MODEL=gpt-4-vision-preview  # WRONG - should be "computer-use-preview"
```

## 3. HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK

### Current Flow (Playwright-only)
1. User clicks "Start Autonomous Browsing"
2. Playwright opens browser
3. Playwright auto-logs in
4. Playwright tries to find "View Profile" button (FAILS if already on profile)
5. Would evaluate with Decision Mode
6. Would send/skip based on decision

### With CUA Enabled (what we built but haven't tested)
1. User clicks "Start Autonomous Browsing"
2. CUA takes screenshot via Playwright
3. CUA suggests actions (click coordinates, text to type)
4. Playwright executes those actions
5. Loop back to step 2 with new screenshot
6. Decision evaluation same as above

## 4. THE DECISION FLOW (answering your question)

### How it mirrors your ChatGPT workflow:

**Your manual process:**
1. Copy profile from YC
2. Paste to ChatGPT with your criteria
3. ChatGPT says YES/NO + rationale + draft message
4. You copy message and send

**Our automated version (Hybrid mode):**
1. Playwright reads profile text
2. Rubric checks keywords (Python, FastAPI, etc.) â†’ score
3. If score >= threshold â†’ call OpenAI GPT-4:
   - "Here's a profile: [text]"
   - "Here's criteria: [your requirements]"
   - "Should we match? Give rationale and draft message"
4. If GPT-4 says YES â†’ Playwright sends the message

## 5. WHAT NEEDS FIXING

### Fix 1: Enable CUA properly
```env
CUA_MODEL=computer-use-preview  # Correct model name
ENABLE_CUA=1  # Turn it on
```

### Fix 2: Handle already-on-profile case
```python
# In click_view_profile():
if "/candidate/" in page.url:
    # Already on a profile, no need to click
    return True
```

### Fix 3: Better login verification
```python
# After login, ensure we're on the right page
if not is_logged_in():
    raise Exception("Login failed")
```

## 6. ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### Why Playwright + CUA together?
- **CUA**: The "brain" - analyzes screenshots, decides what to click
- **Playwright**: The "hands" - executes clicks, takes screenshots
- They work together: CUA can't execute actions itself, needs an executor

### Why both options?
- **Playwright-only**: Faster, more reliable for known sites
- **CUA mode**: Handles dynamic UIs, unexpected layouts, new sites

### Decision modes make sense:
- **Rubric**: Fast pre-filter (no API cost)
- **Advisor**: Smart decisions (like your ChatGPT)
- **Hybrid**: Best of both - filter first, then confirm

## 7. NEXT STEPS TO MAKE IT WORK

1. **Fix the profile detection** (already on profile vs need to click)
2. **Test CUA mode** with correct model name
3. **Verify decision flow** actually evaluates and sends
4. **Add better logging** to see what's happening

The code is 90% there - just needs these fixes to work!
