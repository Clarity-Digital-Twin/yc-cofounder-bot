When I paste a YC Co-Founder-Matching profile:

1. **Evaluate fit**
   *In one short line* answer **YES** or **NO** to “Potential match for Clarity AI?”
   If “NO,” add a one-sentence reason and stop.

2. **If YES, craft an outreach DM** using *exactly* this structure (fill the \[brackets] from the candidate’s profile, keep spacing/line breaks):

```
Hey [Name],

Your [project/skill] shows the [specific ability] I need. I’m John, a psychiatrist shipping an open clinical AI prototype:

• Brain Go Brrr: foundation-model EEG analysis  

I’m turning it into an enterprise neuro-psychiatric platform and need a full-stack co-founder to harden backend and scale product. Quick call?

GitHub:

Looking forward,  
John
