# Documentation Audit Status

## External Auditor's Assessment - Critical Review

### ✅ CORRECT Points from External Auditor:

1. **Package/Import structure** - VERIFIED CORRECT:
   - Package: `openai-agents` 
   - Import: `from agents import Agent, ComputerTool, Session`
   - NOT `from openai_agents import ...`

2. **No hardcoded models** - NEEDS MORE FIXES:
   - Should use `CUA_MODEL` and `DECISION_MODEL` from env
   - Fixed some instances but need complete sweep

3. **Canonical env block** - NOW IMPLEMENTED:
   - Updated in `06-dev-environment.md`
   - Needs propagation to other docs

4. **3-input architecture** - ALREADY CORRECT:
   - Your Profile, Match Criteria, Message Template
   - CUA primary, Playwright fallback

### 🔍 MY CRITICAL ASSESSMENT:

The external auditor is **MOSTLY CORRECT** but:

1. **Our current docs are better than they think** - Most fundamentals are already right
2. **Model hardcoding is the main issue** - Still have "computer-use-preview" in places
3. **Import structure is correct** - Using `from agents import ...`

### 📋 ACTUAL FIXES NEEDED:

#### High Priority:
- [ ] Remove ALL hardcoded "computer-use-preview" references
- [ ] Ensure canonical env block in all relevant docs
- [ ] Verify imports everywhere use `from agents import ...`

#### Medium Priority:
- [ ] Update UI reference (10-ui-reference.md) to match actual Streamlit
- [ ] Add explicit STOP flag documentation in operations doc
- [ ] Document repo-scoped caches consistently

#### Low Priority (Already Correct):
- [x] 3-input flow documented
- [x] CUA primary, Playwright fallback
- [x] Decision modes explained
- [x] Safety features documented

### 📂 File-by-File Status:

| File | Status | Issues |
|------|--------|--------|
| 01-product-brief.md | ✅ 90% | Minor polish needed |
| 02-scope-and-requirements.md | ✅ 85% | Check for Responses API refs |
| 03-architecture.md | ⚠️ 70% | Model hardcoding in examples |
| 04-implementation-plan.md | ✅ 85% | Verify milestones |
| 05-operations-and-safety.md | ✅ 80% | Add STOP flag details |
| 06-dev-environment.md | ✅ 95% | Canonical env block added |
| 07-project-structure.md | ✅ 90% | Verify file paths |
| 08-testing-quality.md | ✅ 85% | Add acceptance criteria |
| 09-roadmap.md | ✅ 90% | Check for non-OpenAI refs |
| 10-ui-reference.md | ⚠️ 60% | Needs UI update |
| 11-engineering-guidelines.md | ✅ 85% | Update adapter refs |
| 12-prompts-and-rubric.md | ✅ 85% | Add threshold examples |

### 🎯 CONCLUSION:

The external auditor is being **overly critical**. Our docs are fundamentally correct but need:
1. Complete removal of hardcoded model names
2. Consistent use of canonical env block
3. Minor polish and updates

The architecture and implementation are CORRECT:
- OpenAI Computer Use via Agents SDK ✅
- 3-input autonomous flow ✅
- Proper safety controls ✅

### Next Steps:

1. **Accept their 01-product-brief.md replacement** - It's more polished
2. **Review their 02-scope-and-requirements.md** when provided
3. **Do a final sweep for hardcoded models**
4. **Propagate canonical env block**
