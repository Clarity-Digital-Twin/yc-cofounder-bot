I'm technical, ready within three months, and have some ideas, but I'm also open to exploring other ideas.
I'm willing to do Product, Engineering, Sales and marketing, Design, and Operations.

About Me
Intro
Hey I'm Dr. Jung, a psychiatrist and builder. I'm currently shipping Brain Go Brrr: a clinical-grade EEG analysis platform for neurologists and psychiatrists. [https://github.com/Clarity-Digital-Twin/brain-go-brrr](https://github.com/Clarity-Digital-Twin/brain-go-brrr)

Brain Go Brrr automates seizure/abnormality detection and sleep staging using a foundation model for EEGs ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19779](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19779)), cutting review time from hours to minutes with clinician-in-the-loop reporting and clear EHR outputs.

I believe frontier tech can empower clinicians and patients, with practical solutions first, investor-driven scale second. I'm also open to exploring other health-tech ideas with the right co-founder.

Life Story
After medical training at Mount Sinai, the 2024-25 breakthroughs convinced me that AI would revolutionize psychiatry and medicine. I quickly pivoted away from traditional full-time clinical practice into software engineering. I’m now building openly to accelerate research and establish trust in psychiatric AI.

Free Time
Off work you’ll find me with my husky mix, a film camera, or at the gym.

Other
Ideally, we’d partner up, rapidly iterate toward product-market fit, and then seek funding to scale our impact. Unlike the typical “idea guy,” I’m a clinical expert who codes daily and ships first.

My Background
Impressive accomplishment
I completed dual board certifications in Psychiatry, but pivoting to tech after recognizing the AI breakthroughs of 2024–2025 felt even more impactful. I’m now fully dedicated to building transformative clinical software.

Education
B.S. Physiology — UCLA (2010)
M.S. Physiology — University of Cincinnati (2012)
M.D. — The Ohio State University College of Medicine (2016)
Psychiatry Residency — Ohio State Wexner Medical Center & Larkin Community Hospital (2022)
Addiction Psychiatry Fellowship — Mount Sinai Beth Israel (2024)

Employment
Telehealth Psychiatrist — TimelyCare (Feb 2023 – Present)
Addiction Psychiatrist — Realization Center, NYC (Oct 2023 – Sep 2024)
Addiction Psychiatry Fellow (PGY-5) — Mount Sinai Beth Israel (Jul 2023 – Jun 2024)
Outpatient Addiction Psychiatrist — Advanced Recovery Systems (Jan 2023 – Apr 2023)

Potential ideas
Brain Go Brrr is an open, clinical-grade EEG analysis platform powered by a foundation model for EEGs ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19779](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19779)). Code is open and in active development: [https://github.com/Clarity-Digital-Twin/brain-go-brrr](https://github.com/Clarity-Digital-Twin/brain-go-brrr).

We’re starting with high-value neurology tasks—automatic seizure/abnormality detection and sleep staging—to cut review time from hours to minutes while keeping clinicians in the loop and exporting structured reports into the EHR.

From there, we’ll extend into psychiatry by deriving EEG biomarkers (e.g., psychosis risk signals, mood-instability markers, attention/arousal indices) and enabling closed-loop biofeedback to personalize care.

I’m also open to co-founding a greenfield idea with the right partner. For example, a “Cursor for EMRs” that uses agents to safely build compliant clinical workflows.

What I'm looking for in a co-founder
I want a co-founder who is not set on a specific idea, technical, in my country (United States), and aligned with my interests.
Ideally, my co-founder is ready within three months.

Ideal co-founder
You’re a full-stack engineer who thrives across the stack—from refining Python ML models and FastAPI APIs, to crafting clean React interfaces and scaling cloud infrastructure. You write clean, tested code and enjoy turning prototypes into reliable services ready to scale.

Clinical experience isn’t necessary, but clear communication, practical problem-solving, and a strong bias for shipping are essential.
